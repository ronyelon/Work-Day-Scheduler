<h2><p>User Story:</p></h2>

<p>AS AN employee with a busy schedule</p>
<p>I WANT to add important events to a daily planner</p>
<p>SO THAT I can manage my time effectively</p>

<h2><p>Acceptance Criteria:</p></h2>

<p>GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule</p>
<p>WHEN I open the planner</p>
<p>THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar</p>
<p>WHEN I scroll down</p>
<p>THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours</p>
<p>WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day</p>
<p>THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future</p>
<p>WHEN I click into a timeblock</p>
<p>THEN I can enter an event</p>
<p>WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock</p>
<p>THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage</p>
<p>WHEN I refresh the page</p>
<p>THEN the saved events persist</p>
